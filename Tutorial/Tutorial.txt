This is a Tutorial about how to use MoogStokes and the associated Moog960 data structures

Each python program has usage instructions in the comments.

The order of execution is:

1) generateGrid.py - This generates a grid of raw synthetic spectra and saves
      the raw data files to disk. The configuration parameters can be found in
      generateGrid.cfg

2) convolveGrid.py - This reads in the raw data files and processes them, using a
      vsini and instrumental resolving power, to facilitate comparisons with observed
      spectra.  The convolved grid is then saved to disk.

3) blendModels.py - This program reads in the grid of convolved spectra, and 
      interpolates between grid points to return a spectrum of arbitrary parameters,
      given that the parameters fall within the coordinates of the grid (extrapolation
      is not allowed)

4) readBlended.py
